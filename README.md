# 🚗 mtcars Analysis Project (Learning R)

This is a personal **portfolio project** focused on learning and applying **R** for data analysis. 
I'm using the classic `mtcars` dataset to explore statistical concepts, create visualizations, and build meaningful insights.

> 📚 I'm actively learning R while developing this project. The code will improve over time as I gain more experience!

## 📊 Project Goals

- Learn and apply **R** for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
- Use the `mtcars` dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Practice clean coding and reproducibility with RMarkdown / R scripts
- Gradually expand the project into more advanced topics like:
  - Linear regression
  - Correlation analysis
  - ggplot2 visualizations
  - Basic statistical tests

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- ✅ Learn the basics of R syntax, tidyverse, and visualization
- 🔄 Continuously refactor code as I improve
- 🧠 Add deeper statistical analysis as I study more
- 🌐 **Transform the project into a Python web app** using:
  - Django for backend
  - Simple frontend with HTML/CSS
  - Animations and FX with JavaScript
